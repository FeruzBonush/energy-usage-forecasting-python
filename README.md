## 📊 Interactive Dashboard (Streamlit)

This project includes an interactive Streamlit dashboard that allows users to:

- Visualise historical hourly electricity consumption
- Compare a naive baseline forecast with a Random Forest model
- Explore actual vs predicted energy usage using a date range slider

The dashboard loads the dataset locally from the `data/` folder and is designed to fail gracefully if the dataset is missing.
