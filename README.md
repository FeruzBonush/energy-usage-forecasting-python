**Energy Usage Forecasting (Python, Streamlit, Machine Learning)**  
Built an end-to-end time-series forecasting project using 4 years of smart-meter data. 
Engineered lag and rolling features, trained a Random Forest model, and evaluated performance against a naive baseline using MAE and RMSE. 
Developed an interactive Streamlit dashboard to visualise historical consumption and model predictions.
